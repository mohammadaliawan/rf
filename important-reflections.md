Important Reflections

1.Dont Quit!! Whatever Happens just Dont Quit!! However Bad you feel!! Just Dont quit. Keep Working on the LS Course. Dont Stop. Becuase if you give up now. You are going to waste a lot of time. You are eventually come back to it. But when you do you will have wasted a lot time and its going to take you longer to complete the course!!

2. Practice Mindfullness. Let all thoughts come and go. Let them just be. Dont Argue with them. Dont try to reason. Becuase you cannot. You have tried and failed. The past is theproof of that. So let it go. Dont think about is this what you shouldbe doing. This is what you are supposed to be doing: Coose something and just stick with it. Whatver your thoughts might say/ If theere is one thing you can not trust. Its yoaur thoughts.
