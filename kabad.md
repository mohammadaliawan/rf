KABAD Part 1 
A Life Full of Troubles...

I want to start by telling you about a word in the Quran in today’s reflection. It’s kabad كبد and occurs in surat al Balad (90).

You know the pinch in your ribs you feel sometimes when you’re totally out of breath from running or exhaustion? When it becomes hard to inhale and exhale because every on of those becomes a strain? Well that’s what the ancient Arabs called kabad. They also used it for liver pains. When someone was overcome with pain, debilitated by exhaustion, whereby the muscles would just become so sore that the mind wants the body to do and it won’t even respond except with pain, yeah that’s kabad. It’s a terrible state of being when your mind can’t think about anything but the pain and just wants relief.

لقد خلقنا الإنسان في كبد
Allah says He certainly created the human being drowned in kabad. Ibn Ashur, (famous, epic commentator on the Quran) commented on the ayah saying that it isn’t a reference only to the physical toil of labor but rather even an emotional and mental human condition.

Kabad is all around you. I don’t have to convince you if that. You live it. You’re in it as He Himself puts it. You experience it from loved ones, from friends, from people you thought were loved ones and friends, from people who despise you, from the world of your own negative thoughts about the past, present and future. Kabad can take the form of financial strain, sickness, injury, regret...the list is endless it seems.

This is the same God that wants us to be grateful, to be optimistic, to be hopeful, to be mindful of His blessings but how can someone do that with their mind overrun with pain and negativity?

The surah in which He informed us that we were created immersed in kabad He tells us a few other startling things. He follows the statement up immediately by describing someone who blows through money frivolously under the assumption that there is no accountability. What’s the connection to kabad? A number of things can be said here but I’ll just share one. When a person wants to surround himself or herself with luxury, entertainment, fine foods etc to make themselves feel like they’ve erased the negative effects of kabad in their life, they’ve only fooled themselves. Throwing money and distraction at this problem won’t make it disappear.

Well then how do you deal with the problem of kabad? Notice I said “deal with”, not “solve”. The Quran didn’t come to eliminate the negative. It didn’t come to make life in this world free of problems. It came to guide humanity so they can deal with their challenges. More on the Qurans response to kabad in my next post.


Kabad part 2

Makkah is a place that should remind me of my helplessness before my Master. The sacred garb I wear reminds me of my mortalit. I reminds me of my utter loss of all that is material & worldly when I come back resurrected. The surrounding climate reminds me of how the most overlooked of blessings like shade, greenery, water and a cool breeze to name a few, are not my birthright. They are priceless grants that I can never possibly pay for because their value is beyond anything i will ever own. The fact that this barren, lifeless, smoldering valley was founded as a city as a result of the divine trials and then the divinely guided prayer given to my father Ibrahim (AS) reminds me that surrender and prayer themselves are sustenance regardless of what you see around you. After all, what is this place without the legacy of Ibrahim AS?










Two people can go through similar tragedy and experience similar pain and yet see things very differently. One of them might see cause for despair, anger and even justification for reacting in reckless and sinful ways. Another might see the same experience as an opportunity to prove ones faith to their Master. If the tragedy occurred clearly as a result of their own wrongdoing, as it so often does, they see it as a wake up call. If it occurs for no discernible fault of their own, they see it as a lesson in humility, returning back to Allah for protection and in weakness, and even a gift. Yes. A gift. In surah 64, if someone can hold on to their faith after being struck with calamity, they get the most valuable thing in return; Allah guides their heart. 
ومن يُؤْمِن بالله يهد قلبه
While in everyday life those who suffer are being offered condolences, in surah 2 those who suffer and persevere with their faith are congratulated 
ولنبلونكم بشيء من الخوف والجوع ونقص من الأموال والأنفس والثمرات وبشر الصابرين الذين إذا أصابتهم مصيبة قالوا إنَّا لله وإنا إليه راجعون
- And We will most certainly and absolutely test you in all manner of things; fear, hunger, loss of wealth, people and fruit, yet congratulations to the persevering patient ones who, when calamity targets them say, no doubt we belong to Allah and no doubt it is only to Him that we are heading back”

Going through kabad even though you’re doing the right thing? Congratulations.

Going through kabad because you can see how you messed up? Thank Allah He woke you up because the only true loss and suffering is losing your faithful, forgiveness seeking, repenting heart.

Going through kabad and you don’t know why? Then find comfort in knowing that it’s one of the above two.

I wrote all this to help you briefly see one of the lessons in the coming ayaat of Surat al balad after mentioning kabad which i discussed in post 1.

“Did We not furnish him with two eyes? A tongue and two lips? And thus We guided him to two pathways”

You can look the two eyes reference here literally as the two beautiful and priceless jewels He decorates our faces with. You can also look at the reference in a literary sense. Two ways of looking at things. And when you look at things with faith, as I referenced from surah 2 above, your tongue and lips declare إنَّا لله وإنا إليه راجعون.

The eye sees, the heart feels and then what is in it pours out from the tongue and thus guidance happens. And if the eye doesn’t see correctly, the heart feels something else, something else comes out of the tongue and we take a different road; the other of the two نجدين.

Its after fajr, I’m sleepy so I’m not about to edit. So if it don’t make no sense, that’s yo problem. Bye. One more post left on this. I think. Ok ok bye.
